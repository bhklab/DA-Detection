# A Package to classify CT scan images, using non-machine learning image processing
This code uses a combination of thresholding, segmentation, and a Radon transform to detect axial CT scan images which contain strong dental artifact streaks. This algorithm works on entire raw images, not just smaller regions of interest, making it ideal for data set labelling.
