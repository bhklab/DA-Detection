# DA-Detection

## About
A collection of algorithms for the automated detection of metal dental artifacts (DA) in computed tomography (CT) scans of head and neck cancer patients.

This module consists of sinogram-based detection (SBD) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) which can be used independently as binary DA classifiers for CT volumes, or together as a three-class DA classifier.
